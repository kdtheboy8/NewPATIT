  * "Colour Bar" enforced wage disparities:
    - White miners: £300/year
    - Black miners: £30/year
- 1913 Natives Land Act:
  * Restricted Africans to 7% of land

4. SOCIAL IMPACT
----------------

4.1 Urbanization

- New Towns:
  * Kimberley: 1885 population 30,000

  * Transvaal gold production exceeded British estimates
  * 1898: Transvaal budget surplus £2.4 million
- War Costs:
  * British expenditure: £217 million
  * 45,000 deaths (mainly from disease)

5.2 Union of South Africa (1910)

  * 6.5 million carats annually
  * 95% from De Beers mines
- Gold:
  * 300 tons annually
  * 40% of world output

6.2 Labour Force (1911 Census)
- Mining Workforce:
  * White: 25,000
  * Black: 275,000
- Wage Disparity:
