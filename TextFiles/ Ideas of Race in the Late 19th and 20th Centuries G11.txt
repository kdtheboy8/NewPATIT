    - Mustard seed filling for cranial capacity
    - Caliper measurements at 17 anatomical points
  * Published results:

    - "African" average: 1,275 cm³ (range 1,150-1,400)

- Paul Broca's Anthropometry (1860s):

    - 78.5 average for French subjects
    - 72.3 average for African subjects
  * Instrumentation:
    - Spreading calipers accurate to 0.1mm
    - 3,247 skulls measured at Paris Anthropological Society

1.2 Eugenics Movement (1890-1940)
- American Eugenics Society Records:

    - 3,700 participants at state fairs
    - Judged on 33 physical/mental traits
  * Forced Sterilizations:
    - California: 9,782 operations (1909-1940)
    - Virginia: 3,000 operations (1927-1972)
    - Surgical methods: 87% vasectomies, 13% salpingectomies

2. COLONIAL RACE THEORIES (1880-1945)

2.1 British Imperial Classifications
- Indian Census Categories (1901):
  * 2,378 distinct castes recorded
  * Martial Races Theory:
    - Preferred recruits: Sikhs (23% of army), Gurkhas (18%)
    - Excluded groups: Bengalis (0.2% of army)
- African Tribal Typologies:
  * 1921 Kenya Colony Handbook:
    - 42 "tribes" officially recognized
    - IQ testing results manipulated to show 15-point European advantage

2.2 French Assimilation Policies
- Indigénat Code Revisions (1887-1944):
  * Subject populations: 15 million in French Africa
  * Naturalization requirements (1912):
    - 10 years residence
    - Read/write French
    - Monogamous marriage
  * Success rate: 0.03% of colonial subjects naturalized by 1939

3. ANTHROPOLOGICAL SHIFTS (1920s-1960s)

3.1 Boasian Revolution
- Franz Boas' Immigrant Study (1908-1910):
  * 17,821 headform measurements
  * Cephalic index changes:
    - Sicilians: 78.2 in Italy → 81.3 in US (1st gen)
    - Eastern European Jews: 83.1 → 80.6
  * Publication impact:
    - 1922 "Early History of Man" sold 12,000 copies

3.2 UNESCO Statements (1950-1967)
- 1950 Expert Panel Composition:
  * 8 physical anthropologists
  * 6 geneticists
  * 4 sociologists
- Key findings:
  * 99.9% genetic similarity across populations
  * 0.1% variation accounts for visible differences
- Dissenting publications:
  * 1962 "Race and Intelligence" monograph sold 45,000 copies

4. RACE AND GENETICS (1930s-1990s)

4.1 Blood Group Studies
- ABO Distribution Research:
  * 1930s global surveys:
    - Type B frequency: 25% in India, 8% in England
    - Type O frequency: 62% in Native Americans
  * Sample sizes: 3.7 million tests by 1955

4.2 DNA Era Discoveries
- Mitochondrial Eve Research (1987):
  * 147 global samples analyzed
  * Mutation rate: 1 per 20,000 years
  * Most recent common ancestor: 200,000 years BP
- Human Genome Project (1990):
  * 3.2 billion base pairs sequenced
  * 99.9% identical across populations

5. INSTITUTIONALIZED RACISM (1900-1980s)

5.1 Jim Crow Measurement
- Plessy v. Ferguson (1896):
  * "One-drop rule" implementations:
    - Virginia Racial Integrity Act (1924): 1/16th threshold
    - Louisiana (1970): 1/32nd threshold
  * Court challenges:
    - 143 racial determination cases (1900-1950)
    - Average trial length: 3.7 days

5.2 Apartheid Classifications
- 1950 Population Registration Act:
  * Race Boards: 37 regional offices
  * Appeal success rates:
    - Coloured to White: 12%
    - Black to Coloured: 3%
  * Skin color measurements:
    - 15 official gradations
    - Reflectometer use from 1962
